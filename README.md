## Background

Dolos - Greek God of Deception

A system that detects potential deception (see what I did there) and returns a result. Each item can be given a score, and if multiple elements are matched, a total score is calculated. Of course you may only want to get back a boolean value to return if its found, so it does that too


## Usage

```sh
$ composer require devtoolboxuk/aegis
```

Then include Composer's generated vendor/autoload.php to enable autoloading:

```sh
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

```sh
use aegis\dolos\Detect;

$dolos = new Detect();
$detection = $dolos->pushHandler();
$detection->getResult();
```
